## Run

To run this application, you have to set your own environmental variables. For security reasons, some variables have been hidden from view and used as environmental variables with the help of dotenv package. Below are the variables that you need to set in order to run the application:

-   MONGO_URI: this is the connection string of your MongoDB Atlas database.

-   JWT_SECRET: a secret message for the session. You can use any string here.

-   JWT_LIFETIME: the time up to which the session token will be active.

After you've set these environmental variables in the .env file at the root of the project, you can run "npm start" in the terminal and the application should work.
